          Fiary started with the idea of solving a common need within the diet community. When a doctor is asked "What am I allergic to?"
          often they respond that the individual needs to start a daily food journal, and write down when they feel sick. This is tenuous, confusing,
          and can get quite lengthy. Fiary solves this app by keeping all your food entries in one place, and we do the correlations for you. Looking for an allergy?
          Look no further. </p>
