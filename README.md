#FIARY
## A web app that combines a food diary and a correlation algorithm that tells if you may have a hidden food allergy. 

##This app was built with
```
the www.recipepuppy.com API
javascript
scss
gulp
local storage
```
##About
```
- A website that is a diary for what you eat. Plug in your meals, and also when you feel sick. The app will recommend recipes, tell you your eating history, and will tell you if something you are eating is making you sick, (using a correlation algorithm). 
- This app helps users find food allergies for themselves or their children. It is a website which records everything a user eats alongside when they get sick, and then prints the correlation for the top food items that correlate with being sick. Common practice for general doctors is to tell patients to 'keep a food diary' when they complain about persisting stomach symptoms, and to write down when they get sick. This is burdensome, time consuming, and can be confusing. This app will make this process simple, and help mothers track their children as well.
