#FIARY
## A web app
```
FIARY is a web app that combines a food diary with a a health tracker. By inputing each meal, its ingredients, and when you get sick, FIARY helps by computing which ingredients most often get sick after eating. This helps with finding food allergies, helping maintain a stable diet, and overall health tracking. One can also use this to track their children's health, or measure how health fluctuates on a highly restrictive diet.

FIARY combines three main functions - the diary for recording meals, the ability to correlate symptoms with actual ingredients, and the ability to search for recipes. These combine to help facilitate a user to move towards optimal health.

##About
```
- A web app diary for what you eat. Plug in your meals, and also when you feel sick. The app will help you find recipes, tells you your eating history, and tells you if something you are eating could be making you sick.
_ The more entries you put in, the more accurate the correlations will become. After finding a possible correlation, try changing your diet and see if health improves. If after experimentation the correlation between a symptom and a food item persists, we suggest that you get an allergy test or visit your doctor to dive into what should be your next step.
- FIARY does not diagnose food allergies. We simply help point users into the right direction. A correlation may be spurious or accurate depending on how entries are made and how diverse the entries are.
- This app helps users find food allergies for themselves or their children. It completes this by printing the correlation for each ingredient ate alongside symptoms. Common practice for general doctors is to tell patients to 'keep a food diary' when they complain about persisting stomach symptoms or health issues. This is burdensome, time consuming, and can be confusing. This app makes this process simple, and can be consistently maintained over long periods of time.
